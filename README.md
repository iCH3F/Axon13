# Axon13

Axon13 is an updated and expanded upon version of <a href="https://github.com/Baw-Appie/Axon">Axon</a> by NepetaDev, <a href="https://twitter.com/BawAppie">Baw Appie</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/_kritanta">Kritanta</a>.

I have forked it to update and maintain it for iOS 13+

This tweak is designed to clear the clutter on your lock screen and give you the priority hub you deserve
